        preBuild:
          commands:
            # 1) Use Node 18 so that Web Streams APIs (ReadableStream) are available
            - nvm install 18
            - nvm use 18

            # 2) Install the new local Expo CLI (as a dev dependency), if not done yet
            #    You can do this once in your project:
            #       cd dungeonbox-web
            #       npm install --save-dev @expo/cli
            #    or you could install it globally -- but local is recommended
            #    For demonstration, we'll assume it's already in package.json.

            # 3) Install your project dependencies
            #    We'll assume you have a package-lock.json. Otherwise, fallback to npm install.
            - npm ci || npm install

        build:
          commands:
            # 4) Use the new local Expo CLI to export a Metro-based web build
            #    This outputs to `dist/` by default
            - npx expo export --platform web

      artifacts:
        # 5) Amplify will deploy all files from `dist/`
        baseDirectory: dist
        files:
          - '**/*'

      cache:
        # 6) Cache node_modules for faster subsequent builds
